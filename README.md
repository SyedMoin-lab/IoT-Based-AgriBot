# IoT-Based Agribot: Design and Fabrication

This repository contains the project files, source code, and documentation for an IoT-based Agribot designed for enhancing agricultural practices through automation and remote monitoring.

## Overview

The IoT-based Agribot is a robotic system developed to assist farmers in various agricultural tasks, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The Agribot is equipped with sensors, actuators, and a communication module to gather real-time data from the field, make intelligent decisions, and perform tasks autonomously or under remote supervision.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Integration:** Utilizes various sensors (e.g., moisture, temperature, humidity) for data collection from the agricultural environment.
- **Actuator Control:** Enables control of actuators (e.g., irrigation system, harvesting mechanism) based on collected data or user commands.
- **IoT Connectivity:** Communicates data to a centralized server or cloud platform for remote monitoring and analysis.
- **Autonomous Operation:** Capable of autonomous navigation within the field for performing designated tasks.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring, controlling the Agribot, and accessing collected data.
